## Neighborhood_Map

#### This app uses both [Goole map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and [foursquare API] (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) to search for places of your interest and returns list of results which is clickable for more details.

#### To Use:
* Type in things or places you would like to explore like pizza or Boston, MA in the search box, or pizza near Boston, MA, just like when you use google map.
The search box is autocomplete enabled. Then hit enter.
* Your results will be listed in the Results box based on their rating. A marker for each result place will appear on the map and upon click, an infowindow will show up.
* Each result in the box is also clickable. The marker will be dropped and an info window with more details will show up when you click the marker.
* If you want to start a new search, simply re-enter things in the search box and hit enter.
